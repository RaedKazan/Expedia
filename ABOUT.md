Expedia application bulid in .Net core using MVC

I have chosen .net core because i'm currently working on this field, and picked MVC architecture pattern which helps in separation the code 
in three parts(Modle,Control,View),So my code will be readable and maintainable.

Also i used Depenedency injection to keep my services loosely coupled.

With this application I learned a lot of things  first of all whats Json API and how it works ,How to initiate HTTP call,How to deserialize Json response to strongly type object,Depenedency injection how it works and whats the benefits of it ,Github ,Also how to host on [Horuko](https://expedia-hotel-.herokuapp.com/) and Travis-CI it was a little bit challenging to build C# on those sites
almost everything i faced in this assignment was new to me.
