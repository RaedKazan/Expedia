Expedia application is built in .Net core using MVC

I chose .net core because I'm currently working on this field, The application was based on MVC architecture pattern which helps to separate the code into three main parts (Controllers, Views and Models), this kind of separation helps to make my code readable, maintainable and easy to test.

Also I used Depenedency injection to keep my services loosely coupled.

With this application I learned a lot of things  first of all whats Json API and how it works ,How to initiate HTTP call,How to deserialize Json response to strongly type object,Depenedency injection how it works and whats the benefits of it ,Github ,Also how to host on [Horuko](https://expedia-hotel-.herokuapp.com/) and Travis-CI it was a little bit challenging to build C# on those sites
almost everything I faced in this assignment was new to me.
